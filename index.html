  <br><br><br>  <h3>Any successful organization understands the importance of hiring a right candidate that’s why on an average most companies spend months of time and thousands of money to
    choose the right candidate. Hiring unqualified candidates is like suicide in the business world.
    Hiring unqualified candidate shows the decision-making power of an organization and it also affects the company’s goodwill and market value.</h3>
<br><br><br><br>
    <h2 class="hj">Cost of a Bad Hire:<h2>
<h3>When an organization hires unqualified candidate, it starts a whole cycle in which organizations faces so many problems and most important the waste of money it causes to the organization.
The company pays the prices for breaking that cycle by replacing bad candidate but taking a good decision is very important because it can start the whole cycle again. These are the costs a company bears when hiring a bad candidate.
<ol>
<li class="hg"> Expenses in hiring:</li>
To hire a candidate for a post in a company an organization spends money on selecting candidates, scheduling interviews, taking interviews, hotel expenses, travel fair and food expenses.

The cost of hiring a candidate increases if the post for which organization recruiting is higher in rank.

For example, when a organization schedules recruitment process for low rank, they do not bother the top management and decisions made on managerial level that’s why expenses bear by the company is low. But on the other hand when a company hires high-rank individual, expenses do become high because top management get involved and all the arrangement made by company also have high standard.
<br><br>
<li class="hg"> Salary:</li>
When an organization hires the bad candidate and pay salary monthly, it all goes to waste. If the services company get in exchange for salary are of poor quality or low standard then company faces other problems as well.

Company faces double loss after hiring a bad candidate, for example, company is already paying salary to the bad candidate because he/she is part of organization but the task he/she is getting salary for is still not done then company going to need someone else to the work or existing worker needs to do the extra work. This is all because of one unqualified candidate company paying more amounts for a work that can be done on lower price.
<br><br>
<li class="hg"> Training cost:</li>
Training cost is the money company spends on the new candidates to train them for the work. If the candidate is unqualified for the job then the money organization is spending on him is going to be a total waste.

Sometimes it does happen that the trading cost of an employee goes higher than the estimated cost. An unqualified candidate causes only problems for the organization.
<br><br>
<li class="hg"> Replacement cost:</li>
According to a report, the replacement cost of a candidate is nearly 20% of his annual salary and this goes all to waste because of a decision of choosing a candidate for the job.

All of the procedure of hiring new candidate begins when you want to replace the unqualified candidate and the money you spent on this existing candidate goes to waste.

Replacement cost goes high when the candidate is of higher rank or work for a long duration in the organization.
<br><br>
<li class="hg"> Cost of bad work:</li>
You can’t expect a high quality of work from an unqualified candidate. The work done by an unqualified candidate never meet the expectation and this cause money loss as well as reputation of an organization in front of clients and delegates.

Hiring an unqualified candidate is a risk where lots of things are on the stack because the person is not qualified for the job and you can’t expect top quality work from someone who is not even suitable for the job.</h3>
</ol>
<h2 class="hj">Effects of Hiring Unqualified Employees:</h2>
<h3>Hiring unqualified candidates affect organization in more ways than you think. Everything is co-related to each other in an organization and hiring a candidate is a part of the cycle where unqualified candidate sets the whole cycle of work on the wrong way and company has to pay the price of a wrong decision of hiring an unqualified employee. These are the effects of hiring an unqualified employee.
<ol>
<li class="hg"> Reputation: </li>
The reputation of an organization depends on the basis of the work they do and their employee. If an organization hires an unsuitable candidate for the job it shows the poor decision-making skill of the organization and you cannot gain good reputation in the market if your employee is not qualified for the job. The reputation of an organization affects in a very bad manner after hiring an unqualified candidate. So choosing a right candidate is a must for any organization.
<br><br>
<li class="hg"> Company good will:</li>
Hiring unqualified candidate can damage company good will. Hiring unqualified candidate is like a big stain on company good will and it represents how unfit an organization is by not hiring right candidates and it will look bad in front of potential clients and customers.

If the candidate is from the higher rank in the organization then it affects more because an unqualified worker is less harmful than unqualified manager due to the responsibilities they have on their shoulder and decisions they take when working for the organization.
<br><br>
<li class="hg"> Client satisfaction:</li>
Client satisfaction is what a company works for and also to gain profit. Client satisfaction means that organization doing their work in right manner and employees are qualified because you cannot attain client’s satisfaction by unqualified employees. Client satisfaction also boosts worker confidence and your image in the marketplace.

Hiring unqualified candidate result in the unsatisfied client because of the work they do, this can put the burden on other employees as well because now they have to work hard and more to keep the client satisfied.
<br><br>
<li class="hg"> Quality of work:</li>
The quality of work also decreases by hiring an unqualified candidate. The high quality of work is what make you successful in the business world and an unqualified candidate affects the quality of the work in the organization because he/she doesn’t suit the qualifications company needed and not suitable for the work because he/she have no knowledge of that work.

For example, you cannot expect good managerial work from an artist or musician because managing an organization is not what they are good in.
<br><br>
<li class="hg"> Wastage of time:</li>
Hiring unqualified candidate is just waste of time because the time you spend on hiring unqualified candidate never work in your favor and company will need to start the recruitment process again. So the time spent on the wrong candidate goes to waste and time is very crucial to the success of the organization.

You cannot do your work if you don’t have right candidates to perform the task and hiring a right candidate is what organization need but selecting an unqualified candidate set everything on wrong track and waste so much time. Time is money when it comes to the business world.</h3>

 <h2 class= "hgg">How do you know if you are unqualified for a job? </h2>
   <h3> You would know if you are unqualified for a job if you do not meet the requirements
     for the job. People often think that they are overqualified for a job because of the Dunning-Kruger Effect.
     This will be explained in the video on the left.
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 class= "hggg"> A recommendation to business owners/ organizations
  is to invest in quaility management systems such ISO 9001. </h2>
  <img style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;"width="200" height="150"src="https://www.cubbison.com/hubfs/industry-iso-9001-2015.png"
<p><h3>ISO 9001 is defined as the international standard that specifies requirements
for a quality management system (QMS). Organizations use the standard to
demonstrate the ability to consistently provide products and services that
meet customer and regulatory requirements. It is the most popular standard
in the ISO 9000 series and the only standard in the series to which
organizations can certify.</p>
ISO 9001 was first published in 1987 by the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO), an international agency composed of the national
standards bodies of more than 160 countries. The current version of ISO 9001
was released in September 2015.</h3>
<h2 class= "hggg"> Benefits of using ISO 9001</h2>
<h3>ISO 9001 helps organizations ensure their customers consistently
    receive high quality products and services, which in turn brings many
    benefits, including satisfied customers, management, and employees.

Because ISO 9001 specifies the requirements for an effective quality
management system, organizations find that using the standard helps them:
<ul>
<li>Organize a QMS</li>
<li>Create satisfied customers, management, and employees</li>
<li>Continually improve their processes</li>
<li>Save costs</li>
</ul>
In Nevada, the Clark County School District used ISO 9001 to save
$174 million over 10 years in actual expenditures and cost avoidance.
More than 3,000 employees were trained to the standard, enabling three
critical components of the system’s success: training, communication and
respect, and efficiency.</h3>

<br>
 <h3>ISO 9001 states the requirements for your Quality Management System (QMS).
 There are 10 sections (clauses) in ISO 9001, with additional subclauses
 related to the Plan-Do-Check-Act system. However, only sections 4-10 contain
 requirements that are auditable. To successfully implement ISO 9001:2015
 within your organization, you must satisfy the requirements within clauses
 4-10 along with meeting customer and applicable statutory and regulatory
 requirements.</h3>
