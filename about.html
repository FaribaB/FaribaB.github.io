       <h2>
        On Sunday 2nd August, 2020, my dog, Zelda, passed away because of anaemia and tick fever.
        This horrible mishap could have been prevented if her veterinarian had made a proper
        diagnosis when I took Zelda to her clinic for a review after I noticed a change in
        her behaviour and daily routine. Due to her lack of qualifications and experience, even negligence,
        the veterinarian disregarded the signs which were evidently visible. If the required corrective actions were taken,
        my pet, Zelda, could have been alive today. This dilemma has greatly impacted the way in which I view the level of service offered by various organizations.
        As such, I firmly believed that quality, care and due diligence should always be a part of a service provider's policy. In this regard,
        this organization was named after Zelda's nickname, Pwidlé. It was formed in order to spread
        awareness about how unqualified members in a workplace can negatively you, your community or your country on a whole.</h2>
